# sensor_platform_breadboard_example

The fritzing file uploaded by Liu Hanxi is the temperary prototype of sensor platform for wbk of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
PCB in the file is only a support to understand the how the breadboard prototype of sensor platform works. Final PCB will
only include nodemcu(esp8266 modul) and periphery components like screw terminals,headers,etc.
